REQUIRES <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/timeless-and-classics-zero">TACZ</a> TO RUN
</h1>

Note: could be used with the hordes for a more challening experience. 

This mod makes each shot matter, if you shoot too much a horde will be triggered at your location.

To add more difficulty (and usage for silencers) in TacZ, hordes of zombies from far away can now hear your gun's noise and WILL be attracted to it, each shot now has an impact and stealth doesn't seem like that bad of an option.
